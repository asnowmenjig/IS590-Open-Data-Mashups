## Conference Talk Proposal

### Speaker Bio

Jasmine Wong [she/her/hers] is a Master's student in Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In her research, she explores themes of representation and bias in the Western literary canon and literary history using Python text mining methods.



### Talk Title

Making the Zoo Work for You: Python and Pandas for Humanities Data



### Description

*(a few concise paragraphs)*


In this talk, I will explore a ///////////

and share how you can use the Python Pandas package to manipulate your data.

The talk will address 

This 


aggregated citation data from 



### Who and Why?

*(1-2 paragraphs)*

**WHO:**
This talk is specifically designed for humanities scholars new to Python methods and Pandas dataframes, particularly those working with large catalog datasets and name data. It is intended to give a very brief overview of how Pandas can be used to illustrate data in an interface that is more familiar and approachable to anyone who has used a spreadsheet. The talk will feature practical demonstrations of several Python/Pandas methods and empower new Python users to implement these methods in their own research.

It may attract a broader audience of Python practitioners interested in learning about humanities data manipulation and digital humanities research. It may also be of interest to other Western literary canon scholars and literary historians using digital methods in their research. The speaker hopes that audience members will take the methods discussed and apply them to their own research.

**BACKGROUND:**

No experience with Python assumed, but attendees should have basic knowledge of Excel spreadsheets and familiarity with spreadsheet formatting. Data cleaning will be briefly mentioned but not discussed in-depth during this presentation. Participants need not bring their own data, but bringing a laptop and pre-installing Jupyter Notebook is heavily encouraged.

### ADDITIONAL NOTES

Due to time constraints, speaker will likely create a specialized Jupyter Notebook for this talk that contains stripped-down data that has been tidied further to avoid the need for demonstrating data cleaning methods during the presentation. This is to avoid confusing participants and keep the presentation more streamlined and focused on data processing. Jupyter Notebook will be provided to attendees prior to the presentation, will instructions for installation and brief introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, so participants can follow along.
